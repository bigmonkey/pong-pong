      <h1>What Happens Next</h1>
      <div>Once you apply your application it is sent to our network of payday lenders, one of the largest in the country. If a lender accepts your application you will be sent to that specific lender's website to review loan terms such as rates, fees and renewal policy. You are responsible for reviewing these terms before accepting the loan so review them carefully. If you accept the loan, cash is deposited into your checking account usually within one business day.</div>

      <div>Applying for a payday loan and paying it off on time does not impact your credit score but failure to repay your loan may hurt your credit score. This is because payday loan companies do not report to credit bureaus but most collection agengies do. 
      </div>
