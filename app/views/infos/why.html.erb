	<h1>Why The Payday Hound?</h1>
							
		<h2>Why use The Payday Hound?</h2>
		<p>The Payday Hound is designed to help users make informed decisions about financial products.</p>
		<p>We aim to be impartial and informed. We specialize in alternative financial products like secured cards, prepaid cards, and payday loans.
		<p>We provide tools for users to find cards based on their usage patterns. We evaluate each product and provide concise analysis of each product as well as in-depth reviews and articles to help users better understand general products features and options.</p>
		<p>The Payday Hound believes providing clear, honest information will help users make better financial choices.</p>

		<h2>How do we make money?</h2>
		<p>The Payday Hound's reviews and rankings are free to users and the site is free of advertising. To keep this service free, we charge some product providers when users click through to the provider's site. This sponsored provider relationship exists with less than 25% of the products listed. Showing unsponsored providers may hurt our monetization, but we believe evaluating all providers regardless of financial relationship helps consumers make informed, better decisions. We believe if we provide honest and impartial reviews, users will continue to trust our reviews, and use our site. We do not identify sponsored providers to ensure that a paid relationship is not interpreted as an endorsement.</P></p>
		<p>If you know of a provider we donâ€™t feature, please email us at <span class="code">&#109;&#111;&#099;&#046;&#100;&#110;&#117;&#111;&#104;&#121;&#097;&#100;&#121;&#097;&#112;&#101;&#104;&#116;&#064;&#107;&#099;&#097;&#098;&#100;&#101;&#101;&#102;</span>.</p>

		<h2>How do our Secured Card rankings work?</h2>
		<p>The Payday Hound ranks each secured card based on pricing. We also provide a description capturing features that can get lost in the fine print. For example, some cards do not have a Grace Period meaning they charge interest immediately on your purchases even if you pay you balance off in full each month. </p>
		<p>PRICING: Pricing includes annual fees, monthly fees, purchase APR and cash advance APR.</p>
		<p>PRICING DOES NOT INCLUDE: Pricing does not include other fees such as late penalties, re-load fees, or application fees. It also does not include the impact of Grace Periods and additional revenue some cards may offer like interest on deposits. We highlight these differences in our description but final terms must always be reviewed on the lender's website.</p>

	 	<h2>How do our Prepaid Cards rankings work?</h2>
		<p>The Payday Hound ranks each prepaid card based on pricing. We also provide a description for what type of user benefits most from each card. </p>
		<p>PRICING: Pricing includes activation fees, monthly fees, ATM fees and signature transaction fees.</p>
		<p>PRICING DOES NOT INCLUDE: Pricing does not include other fees such as bill payment, paper statement fees, or call center fees. These fees are listed in the more information section. We highlight differences in our description but final terms must always be reviewed on the lender's website.</p>		

		<h2>How do our Payday Loan rankings work?</h2>
		<p>The Payday Hound ranks each site based on a &#8220;Sniff Test,&#8221; pricing, and features.</p>
		<p>SNIFF TEST: Lenders score higher on the Sniff Test if they are licensed in each state in which they operate, have physical storefronts, are US based, display contact information, and have a privacy policy. The Sniff Test also incorporates Better Business Bureau ratings, accreditation and complaints.</p>
		<p>COST: Pricing is based on the cost of a $300, 14-day, payday loan in the State of Delaware.</p>
		<p>FEATURES: The Features sections located in each lender's individual review is based on features that differentiate lenders. For example, some lenders provide live chat or phone support, have applications in Spanish, or do not require references. Standard features, such as faxless applications and next business day funding only impact lenders if they do not provide these standard features.</p>
