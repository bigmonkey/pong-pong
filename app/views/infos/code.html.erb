	<h1>The Payday Hound Set Up</h1>
							
		<h2>Why The Payday Hound</h2>
		<p>One of the reasons I started The Payday Hound was to learn how to code. I learn better with a purpose, so rather than just taking tutorials, I decided to create something to help those generally excluded from our traditional banking systems. I have worked in this space for many years and believe they are underserved relative to traditional banking consumers.</p>

		<h2>How The Payday Hound Got Done</h2>
		<p>I started with the courses and books below. These were and continue to be followed up with a lot of <%= link_to'Googling','http://bing.com/' %> and <%= link_to'stackoverflow','http://stackoverflow.com/' %>,
			<ul>
		 		<li><%= link_to "Ruby on Rails 3 Essential Training by Kevin Skoglund", "http://www.lynda.com/Ruby-on-Rails-3-tutorials/essential-training/55960-2.html" %></li>
			 	<li><%= link_to "Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl", "http://ruby.railstutorial.org/" %></li>
		 		<li><%= link_to "JavaScript Essential Training by Simion Allardice", "http://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Essential-Training-2011/81266-2/transcript" %></li> 
		 		<li><%= link_to "The Well Grounded Rubyist by David A. Black", "http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1933988657" %></li>

			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>In addition <%= link_to 'Hacker Hours', 'http://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/'%>, a Meet Up created by <%= link_to 'Aidan','http://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/members/8818215/' %>, has been invaluable. Thank you <%= link_to 'Karl', 'http://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/members/10975022/' %> and <%= link_to 'Chris', 'http://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/members/89426842/' %> at View the Space for all your time and advice.</p>
		<p>Throughout the process, I have also received help from people I have never met. I have been inspired by many developers who continue to create, share and help. I've been saved multiple times by someone, somewhere in the world, in the middle of the night, debugging my code online. Thank you.</p>
		<p>The set up for The Payday Hound is below. The goal was to leverage the ease of Wordpress for its CMS while using Rails for web development. I ended up with the set up below.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><%= link_to 'EC2', 'http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/' %> for web server and php hosting</li>
				<li><%= link_to 'Heroku', 'http://www.heroku.com/' %> for Rails hosting</li>
				<li><%= link_to 'WordPress', 'http://wordpress.org/' %> for articles</li>
