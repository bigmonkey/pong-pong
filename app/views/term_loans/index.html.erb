	<h1>Installment Loans</h1>
	<p>Installment loans, like payday loans, are based on your pay check. The attractiveness of installment loans is that they are quick, simple, do not require good credit, and unlike payday loans, repayment is spread over multiple pay periods. The fees for installment loans do make them an expensive option so make sure you have considered other options such as bank loans, credit cards, or friends and family before taking one of these loans. These loans are best used for short-term, emergency funding.</p>	
	<p>If an installment loan is right for you, the application process can take only 5 to 25 minutes. Money is can be deposited into you account within one business day. This money is a loan and must be repaid in full. When taking out an installment oan, your lender will give you a payment plan. For example, $1,000 could have a repayment plan with a ~$125 payment every pay period (14 days) over the next 24 pay periods. In the end ~$1,000 costs ~$2,400. This is cheaper than what you would have to pay if you took out a payday loan for the same time-frame, but clearly not cheap.</p>
	<p>The difference between installment loans and payday loans is that payments are spread out over time. This reduces the amount of individual payments and your APR but the total amount of fees paid increases a well. See <a href = "/payday-loan-or-installment-loan/")>Payday Loans or Installment Loans</a> for more information. Many consumers prefer installment loans because paying the entire loan at your next pay period, as payday loans require, is often too difficult.<p>
