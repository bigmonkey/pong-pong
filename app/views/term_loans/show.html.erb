			<p><%= @keyWordType=="loans" ? @keyWord.humanize : "Installment loans" %>  do not require good credit and, unlike traditional payday loans, are paid back over multiple pay periods. These loans are relatively expensive loans so make sure you have considered other options such as bank loans, credit cards, or friends and family before taking one.</p>			

			<p>Estimated fees and payments for <%= "#{@state.state}" %> <%= @keyWordType=="lenders" ? @keyWord : "installment lenders" %> are provided in the table below. Many consumers prefer <%= @keyWordType=="loans" ? @keyWord : "installment loans" %> over payday loans because loan repayment is spread out over a longer period of time which often makes these loans cheaper than payday loans if you need multiple pay periods to repay your loan. See <a href = "/payday-loan-or-installment-loan/")>Payday Loans or Installment Loans</a> for more information on comparing the two types of loans. In addtion visit <%= link_to(@keyWordType=="loans" ? "#{@keyWord.titleize}" : "Installment Loans", @keyWordType=="loans" ? @selectorPath : term_loans_path) %> for additional information on these loans.<p>
			<p><%= "#{@state.state}" %> regulation of <%= @keyWordType=="loans" ? @keyWord : "installment loans" %> falls into a bit of a gray area as they sometimes fall outside of the technical definition of a payday loan and more into the area of general unsecured installment loans. See <%= link_to("#{@state.state} Payday Loan Laws", payday_loan_law_path(@state.state_abbr.downcase)) %> for additional resources or visit <%= "#{@state.state}" %>'s payday loan regulator, the <%= link_to("#{@paydaylawstate.regulator}", @paydaylawstate.regulator_site, :rel => 'nofollow') %> for more information.</p>
