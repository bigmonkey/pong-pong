 		These lenders include tribe based lenders and lenders licensed in other states. The basis of their position is that they export their tribe or state laws into <%= @state.state %>. Under this position they are required to adhere to federal lending laws but not <%= @state.state %> regulations. In general Federal laws are less restrictive and less frequently enforced. There are reputable tribal based lenders but quality varies. The final group of lenders is foreign-based payday loan lenders. Their position is that they export their country's laws into <%= @state.state %> and are a bad choice as they are highly unregulated. See <%= link_to("Choosing A Payday Loan", "/choosing-a-payday-loan/") %> for more details. </p>
