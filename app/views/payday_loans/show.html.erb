				<p><%= @state.state %> residents can choose from <%= @state.state %> licensed, out-of-state licensed, tribal-based and foreign-based lenders for their payday loans.</p>	

				<p>Licensed payday lenders are the most consistent option as the <%= @paydaylawstate.regulator %> evaluates, regulates, and monitors these lenders. See <%= link_to("#{@state.state} Payday Loan Laws", payday_loan_law_path(@state.state_abbr.downcase)) %> for more details on <%= @state.state %> laws and regulations.</p>
			<% else %>
			<% #**** for states where payday lending is prohibited %>
				<p>Payday lenders are prohibited by <%= @state.state %> regulators from offering payday loans to <%= @state.state %> residents. This means there are no <%= @state.state %> licensed or regulated payday lenders in <%= @state.state %>. <%= @state.state %> residents may be able to choose from tribal, out-of-state, or foreign-based lenders. See <%= link_to("#{@state.state} Payday Loan Laws", payday_loan_law_path(@state.state_abbr.downcase)) %> for links to <%= @state.state %> banking and finance regulators. These links will provide more information on the legal aspects of payday lending in <%= @state.state %>. In states where payday lending is permitted, lenders are licensed and regulated by the state. </p>  			
			<% end %>
			<% # ****this section is the closing </p> for both cases above %>
	 		<p>Unlicensed lenders include tribe-based lenders, lenders licensed in other states, and foriegn-based lenders. Triable and out-of-state licensed lenders operate under the interpretation that they can export their tribe or state laws into <%= @state.state %> and are required to adhere to federal lending laws but not <%= @state.state %> regulations. Federal laws may be less restrictive and less frequently enforced. The final group of lenders is foreign-based payday loan lenders. They export their countries' laws into <%= @state.state %> and are highly unregulated. See <%= link_to("Choosing A Payday Loan", "/choosing-a-payday-loan/") %> for more details. </p>
	 		<p>The above is our understanding of how payday lending works in <%= @state.state %>, but we are not a law firm. Please contact the <%= link_to("#{@paydaylawstate.regulator}", @paydaylawstate.regulator_site, :rel => 'nofollow') %> for more information. </p>
